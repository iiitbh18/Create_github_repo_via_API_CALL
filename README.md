# Create_github_repo_via_API_CALL
We will be able to see how we can create github repo via API call and user authentication of your gitHub account.



The easiest and best way to authenticate with the GitHub API is by using Basic Authentication via OAuth tokens.
  # <https://api.github.com/user>  // on accesing it, it  has mention requires authentication.
  {
  "message": "Requires authentication",
  "documentation_url": <"https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/users#get-the-authenticated-user">
}
  
To make any requests we need to use  ## <b>request.get('Here is the url to which we want to make our API call',)</b>
